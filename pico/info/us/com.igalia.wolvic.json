This change makes Wolvic more useful and convenient, as it now follows the expected behaviour of a Web browser.\n\n* Hand tracking detection is more reliable. The code that tracks gestures has been refactored to minimize unintended gestures and to give us a more flexible foundation going forward.\n\n* The keyboard's layout will follow the system's language by default, unless the user changes their preferred language or layout within Wolvic. Search suggestions in the URL bar will no longer omit characters.\n\n* We will display a confirmation dialog before re-submitting a POST form. Download dialogs have a nicer appearance. Web prompts will remember the selected option after they are closed and open again.","app_size":"109676905","app_supported_platforms":"PICO 4E, PICO Neo3 Pro, PICO 4","app_supported_player_mode":"Room Scale, Standing, Sitting","app_term_of_service":"https://wolvic.com/legal/terms/","app_update_time":"1691677767","app_version":"1.4.2","app_web_site":"https://wolvic.com"},"videos":[],"sales_status":1,"booking_status_switch":2,"score":4.3,"can_refund":2,"refund_agreement":"https://lf-stone-iot-va.dlpicoxr.com/obj/ies-hotsoon-draft-sg/pico_store/f3ad6060-3433-4680-ba6d-d45a3befcf4a_en.html","wish_list":{"is_show":1,"status":2},"server_expand_extra":"{\"is_sink\":0}","safe_item_id":"7171016990772166662","show_early_access_label":false,"purchase_button_caption":0,"support_cross_install":false,"version":"1.4.2"}
