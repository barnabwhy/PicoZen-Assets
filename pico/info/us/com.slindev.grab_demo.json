When setting a level image, it will be updated immediate if the level has already been published before, otherwise it will happen as part of publishing your level.\n- The windows version now uses the same Vulkan rendering as the Quest version, resulting in much better performance.\n- Networking now always uses a relay server, hopefully fixing connection issues that prevent some people from playing with others.\n- Levels now require a start and an end before they can be verified.\n- Fixed a glitch that allowed players to glitch through a wall with checkpoints.\n- Fixed a very common ghost block bug caused by grappling.\n- When holding on to something with two hands and the hand that grabbed first is too far away from the original grab position, it will now automatically let go. When the first hand was grappling instead, the grapple will break.\n","app_size":"118305196","app_supported_platforms":"PICO Neo3 Link, PICO 4, PICO 4 Pro","app_supported_player_mode":"Standing, Room Scale","app_term_of_service":"https://slin.dev/terms/","app_update_time":"1700685426","app_version":"0.37.0","app_web_site":"https://grabvr.quest"},"videos":[{"video_url":"https://zstatic.us-appstore.picovr.com/developer-platform/submission/assets/videos/2023-05-26/9a2328321eaaab430ddfcbbed4fde20b.mp4","image_url":"https://zstatic.us-appstore.picovr.com/developer-platform/submission/assets/videos/2023-05-26/0c6c2f85f51e8c13433102b5d2eba423.png"}],"sales_status":1,"booking_status_switch":2,"score":3.9,"can_refund":2,"refund_agreement":"https://lf-stone-iot-va.dlpicoxr.com/obj/ies-hotsoon-draft-sg/pico_store/f3ad6060-3433-4680-ba6d-d45a3befcf4a_en.html","comment_rec_score":{"rec_rate":"77%","rec_desc":"Worth a Try"},"wish_list":{"is_show":1,"status":2},"server_expand_extra":"{\"is_sink\":0}","safe_item_id":"3605","show_early_access_label":false,"purchase_button_caption":1,"support_cross_install":false,"version":"0.37.0"}
